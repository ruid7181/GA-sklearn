# GeoAggregator: An Efficient Transformer Model for Geo-Spatial Tabular Data

## üåç Introduction

* We introduce GeoAggregator (GA), an efficient & lightweight transformer architecture
designed specifically for geospatial tabular data modeling.

* GAs explicitly account for spatial auto-correlation and spatial heterogeneity through Gaussian-biased local attention
and global positional awareness.

* We also introduce a new attention mechanism that uses the Cartesian product to manage the size of the model
while preserving a strong expressive power.

### TL;DR: We focus on the spatial regression task of geospatial tabular data...

### ... and propose an efficient and light-weight transformer model named *GeoAggregator*.

## ü§ñ Sklearn-style interface

* We provide a simple sklearn-style interface of **GeoAggregator (GA)**, to apply the model on *your own
  geospatial tabular datasets*.
  
* Through this interface, hyperparameter tuning and model ensemble are made possible.
